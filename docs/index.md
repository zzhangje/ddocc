# Differential Drive Odyssey with Chronos Chain

> 中文版教程请点击[这里](/zh/)。

This is a series of tutorials based on the [Chronos Chain](https://github.com/zzhangje/ChronosChain) framework, specifically designed for tank chassis systems. Each section has a clear task objective, and by completing the designated parts, you can enable the robot to achieve the expected behavior in simulation.

In this tutorial, you will focus on learning how to manage and coordinate various signals and tasks within the robot system without delving into the complexities of low-level hardware drivers. **We will start by building the chassis subsystem, gradually create basic command units, and design more complex robot actions by combining these commands, ultimately completing a full autonomous program.**
